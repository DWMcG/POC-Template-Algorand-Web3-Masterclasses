# Web3 Masterclasses – POC Template

This is a simple starter template for non-technical founders taking part in the Algorand Web3 Masterclasses. It includes:

- Wallet connection  
- Transfer ALGO
- NFT minting  
- Minting your own token *(coming in Session 5)*

Use this to test ideas and enhance your first Web3 proof of concept on Algorand — no coding experience needed.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork this repository

Click the **"Fork"** button at the top right of this page to create your own copy under your GitHub account.

### 2. Open it in Codespaces

1. On your forked repo, click the green **"Code"** button  
2. Select **"Create codespace on main"**  
3. Wait for the Codespace to load (this may take a minute)

Once it opens, everything is already set up and ready to explore.

**Pro Tip:** GitHub Codespaces is included with free accounts but comes with a monthly limit of 60 hours.  

To avoid losing your progress, be sure to **commit your changes regularly** — just like shown in the video demo below — so your updates are saved to your forked repository.
